## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Anthoni0T/anthoni0t** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My Name is Anthoni-Mendoza-Trejo and my email is amtrejo@my.waketech.edu
I just made this account recently to be used for school assignments along with this repository that I made using the + sign at the top right corner. I then proceeded to download the desktop version and signed in. After that got done I got prompted with some options to start but decided on cloning this repository first.
